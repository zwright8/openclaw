# Troubleshooting

If you only have 2 minutes, use this page as a triage front door.

## First 60 seconds

Run this exact ladder in order:

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw status --all
openclaw gateway probe
openclaw gateway status
openclaw doctor
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw logs --follow
```

Good output in one line:

- `openclaw status` → shows configured channels and no obvious auth errors.
- `openclaw status --all` → full report is present and shareable.
- `openclaw gateway probe` → expected gateway target is reachable.
- `openclaw gateway status` → `Runtime: running` and `RPC probe: ok`.
- `openclaw doctor` → no blocking config/service errors.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` → channels report `connected` or `ready`.
- `openclaw logs --follow` → steady activity, no repeating fatal errors.

  <Accordion title="No replies">
    ```bash
    openclaw status
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw channels status --probe
    openclaw pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
    openclaw logs --follow
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Runtime: running`
    - `RPC probe: ok`
    - Your channel shows connected/ready in `channels status --probe`
    - Sender appears approved (or DM policy is open/allowlist)

    Common log signatures:

    - `drop guild message (mention required` → mention gating blocked the message in Discord.
    - `pairing request` → sender is unapproved and waiting for DM pairing approval.
    - `blocked` / `allowlist` in channel logs → sender, room, or group is filtered.

    ```bash
    openclaw status
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw logs --follow
    openclaw doctor
    openclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Dashboard: http://...` is shown in `openclaw gateway status`
    - `RPC probe: ok`
    - No auth loop in logs

    Common log signatures:

    - `device identity required` → HTTP/non-secure context cannot complete device auth.
    - `unauthorized` / reconnect loop → wrong token/password or auth mode mismatch.
    - `gateway connect failed:` → UI is targeting the wrong URL/port or unreachable gateway.

    ```bash
    openclaw status
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw logs --follow
    openclaw doctor
    openclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Service: ... (loaded)`
    - `Runtime: running`
    - `RPC probe: ok`

    Common log signatures:

    - `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local` → gateway mode is unset/remote.
    - `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → non-loopback bind without token/password.
    - `another gateway instance is already listening` or `EADDRINUSE` → port already taken.

    ```bash
    openclaw status
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw logs --follow

    openclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - Channel transport is connected.
    - Pairing/allowlist checks pass.
    - Mentions are detected where required.

    Common log signatures:

    - `mention required` → group mention gating blocked processing.
    - `pairing` / `pending` → DM sender is not approved yet.
    - `not_in_channel`, `missing_scope`, `Forbidden`, `401/403` → channel permission token issue.

    Good output looks like:

    - `cron.status` shows enabled with a next wake.
    - `cron runs` shows recent `ok` entries.
    - Heartbeat is enabled and not outside active hours.

    Common log signatures:

    - `cron: scheduler disabled; jobs will not run automatically` → cron is disabled.
    - `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=quiet-hours` → outside configured active hours.
