# macOS permissions (TCC)

macOS permission grants are fragile. TCC associates a permission grant with the
app's code signature, bundle identifier, and on-disk path. If any of those change,
macOS treats the app as new and may drop or hide prompts.

## Requirements for stable permissions

- Same path: run the app from a fixed location (for OpenClaw, `dist/OpenClaw.app`).
- Same bundle identifier: changing the bundle ID creates a new permission identity.
- Signed app: unsigned or ad-hoc signed builds do not persist permissions.
- Consistent signature: use a real Apple Development or Developer ID certificate
  so the signature stays stable across rebuilds.

Ad-hoc signatures generate a new identity every build. macOS will forget previous
grants, and prompts can disappear entirely until the stale entries are cleared.

## Recovery checklist when prompts disappear

1. Quit the app.
2. Remove the app entry in System Settings -> Privacy & Security.
3. Relaunch the app from the same path and re-grant permissions.
4. If the prompt still does not appear, reset TCC entries with `tccutil` and try again.
5. Some permissions only reappear after a full macOS restart.

Example resets (replace bundle ID as needed):

```bash
sudo tccutil reset Accessibility ai.openclaw.mac
sudo tccutil reset ScreenCapture ai.openclaw.mac
sudo tccutil reset AppleEvents
```

## Files and folders permissions (Desktop/Documents/Downloads)

macOS may also gate Desktop, Documents, and Downloads for terminal/background processes. If file reads or directory listings hang, grant access to the same process context that performs file operations (for example Terminal/iTerm, LaunchAgent-launched app, or SSH process).

Workaround: move files into the OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`) if you want to avoid per-folder grants.

If you are testing permissions, always sign with a real certificate. Ad-hoc
builds are only acceptable for quick local runs where permissions do not matter.
